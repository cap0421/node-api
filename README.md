## More About This API
This API was created so that android applications can communicate with the database that is used to store user data. This API is used to authenticate logins and register users where this API will be deployed to the Google App Engine.

## PS
We're sorry for pushing node_modules to this github, because we forgot to add it to .gitignore at the beginning
